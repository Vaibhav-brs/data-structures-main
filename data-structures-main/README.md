# Data Structures

A data structure (DS) is a systematic way of organizing and storing data to efficiently perform operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval. It helps manage data and optimize algorithms, improving overall program efficiency and reducing memory usage.

Common DS include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables, each designed to address specific data handling requirements.
